            <p>I am in the process of becoming a full-stack developer through nucamp after about 13 years of working in marine animal care. You might be thinking, <em>"How on earth could that skillset transfer to software development?"</em> and you would be asking a question I have also asked myself! You can't manage a habitat with hundreds of living organisms in it without having an eye for detail and an the ability to multi-task with precision, and working with marine life requires more than being a biologist and a chemist. The life support systems that move and filter water all around an aquarium are an intricate set of connecting points and processes that keep things running smoothly. When there is a problem, a systematic approach of walking through and mapping out each system, knowing the principles of how each piece should work, then finding and isolating the problem is needed, just like in coding.</p>
